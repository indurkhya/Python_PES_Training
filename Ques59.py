# Create file called "stringop.py" which has following functions
# i) functions to sort numbers (Use loops for  sorting, do not use built in function)
# ii) function to search given element through binary search method.(Refer to net for the Binary search algorithm)
# iii) function to reverse the given string
# Write new program in file strpackage.py such that you import functions of file "stringop.py" to your new program
